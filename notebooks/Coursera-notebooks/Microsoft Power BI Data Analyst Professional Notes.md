## Skills measured in the Microsoft Exam PL300

- Exam skills measured
- In this section, you’ll review a summary of the topics the exam might cover, and an updated list of skills measured. The exams are updated at least periodically, and the information covered in this reading refers to the English version updated on April 23, 2024.

This segment covers the four high-level topics in the skills measured. 

Prepare the data (25–30%)

Model the data (25–30%)

Visualize and analyze the data (25–30%)

Manage and secure Power BI (15–20%)

The higher the percentage, the more questions that specific section of the exam will contain. For example, ‘Prepare the data’ will account for 15-20% of the questions you might encounter on the exam.

Note: Most questions cover features that are general availability (GA). The exam may contain questions on preview features if those features are commonly used. Preview features are features that aren't complete but are made available on a "preview" basis so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
